PURPOSE
 • My project is basically a resume. I can use it for my future purpose (would improvise it), such as interviews or job-listings. I have done a resume from scratch from secondary and its totally different including the information. I wanted to challenge myself to do better. Furthermore, I am helping juniors who have been referred to me by my friends to guide the former for EAE, so I can use my website as an example to help them and since I did research a lot for this current website and there are several unused ideas I have obtained. So, I would share some of the ideas I have garnered to improvise theirs. Thus, although based on this project resume is meant for recruiters, for personal-wise its for my friends and juniors interested in IT too!
